.TH "SHELL" 1 "18 February 2023" "GNU Shell" "General Commands Manual "
.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.TP
.B ./hsh -> executes
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSimple shell\fR is a prorgramm that provides an interface for users to get access to the kernel's services.
This shell works as a command interpreter in two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
.TP
In this mode, the shell takes the commands from the standard input, executes them and gets ready to read another command-line.
.TP
.B Non-interactive Mode
.TP
This mode reads the commands from a file sent thru a pipe, the commands will be executed and the shell won't ask for more.
.TP
The shell is fully written in C programming language, it uses systemcalls and regular C functions.
.SH ARGUMENTS
This Shell does not support arguments.
.SH INVOCATION
In order to invoke this shell it is necessary to run the \fB./hsh\fR command. We also provided a Makefile to make the compiltion easier.
.SH DEFINITIONS
The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
.TP
.B blank
.TP
A space or a tab
.TP
.B word
.TP
A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a token. They will be gotten by the strtok C function
.TP
.B name
.TP
A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore. Also referred to as an identifier.
.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
A \fB simple command\fR is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator, in this case EOF (CTRL + D or the -1 Return of a function). The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
The return value of a \fBsimple command\fR is its exit status, for this particular Shell, the signal CTRL + D has been supressed.
.SH SHELL VARIABLES
The next variables are set by the Holbishell.
.TP
.B OLDPWD
.TP
The previous working directory as set by the \fB cd\fR command.
.TP
.B PWD
.TP
The current working directory as set by \fB the cd\fR command.
.TP
.B PATH
.TP
The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECUTION below). A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of PATH indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs bash. A common value is ''/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.

If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the Holbishell searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name

.SH ENVIROMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the \fB environment\fR. This is a list of \fB name-value pairs\fR, of the form \fB name=value.\fR

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS
.BR PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of an executed command  is  the value returned by the waitpid system call  or  equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between  0  and  255,though,as explained  below, the shell may use values above 125  specially.

Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special  values  to  indicate specific failure modes.

For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.
If  a  command  is  not  found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.

Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero(false) if an  error occurred  while execution.

Shelley itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax  error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.   See  also the exit builtin command below.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
[\fBcommand\fP] [\fIarguments\fP]
.RS
.IP "\fBcd\fP [\fIdir\fP]"
\- Change the current directory to \fIdir\fP.  if dir is not given, the shell will take the value of the HOME environ-value as default. Given "-", the Shell will go to the OLDPWD address into the enviroment.
.IP "\fBexit\fP [\fIstatus\fP]"
\- The shell will exit with a status of \fIstatus\fP.  If no status is given, the exit status is that of the last command executed.
.IP "\fBenv\fP"
\- Displays all the environmental variables.
.RE
.SH SIGNALS
The SIG_INT (CTRL+D) signal is omitted for the shell, is it not possible to end the process thru it.
